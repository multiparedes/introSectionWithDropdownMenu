## My process

In this challenge I practiced mobile navigations bars and a learnt a little more about JS and DOM manipulation, I discovered to select adjacents elements of a section/div with the `nextElementSibling` function, with this I manged to press the link and expand the dropdown menu, I'm proud of it but i'm open to other options :)

I run in a little issue with the mobile menu and where if I expand the dropdown menu with the icons it shifts, I fixed it by just hidding it, if you don't see it, it dosn't exist jeje. 

UPDATE: I just saw a better way of having the gray background on the mobile view without the need of a new div, only with a `box-shadow` that expands to fullscreen when the hamburger menu is pressed. Ty Kevin Powel.
